        <p>Hello World. I'll be using this place to learn about html.
            <br><br>
            - To add more than one space between tho words, insert the new space using the special marker "&"
            <br>
            Example: Hello &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; World. 
            <br><br>
            - To add a comment in brackets, use the following, removing both asterisk (*):
            <br>"<*!-- --*>"<br>
            -> Don't use this kind of comment to note project standarts. Users are able to read this by acessing the font code of the page.
            <br><br>
            - It's possible to add special characters to the text by using the special marker "&", same as I used to add more than one space between two words.
            <br>
            Examples:<br> 
            -> Euro Symbol: &euro; (& + euro)
            -> Pound: &pound; (& + pound)
            -> Yen: &yen; (& + Yen)
        </p>
